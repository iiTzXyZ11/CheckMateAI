Grade:
Final Grade: 2.5/9.0

Criterion: Understanding of the Theme - Grade: 0.5/3.0 - Justification: The student correctly identifies 'love' as a major theme in *Romeo and Juliet*. However, the explanation provided is extremely superficial ("because they love each other a lot"), demonstrating no depth of understanding of the theme beyond its most obvious presence. Furthermore, the examples given are either too vague ("They met and then things happened") or merely recount plot points ("Juliet drinks something and Romeo dies") without effectively connecting them to or analyzing them in relation to the theme of love.
Criterion: Use of Textual Evidence - Grade: 1.0/3.0 - Justification: The student attempts to provide textual evidence by referencing general plot points such as "They met" and "Juliet drinks something and Romeo dies." However, these references are too vague and lack specific detail to effectively support the stated theme of love. The work fails to explain how these events function as evidence or connect them analytically to the theme, demonstrating a very limited understanding of using textual support.
Criterion: Writing Quality - Grade: 1.0/3.0 - Justification: The student identifies a relevant theme (love) and adheres to the paragraph length requirement; however, the explanation of the theme is extremely superficial and lacks depth. The provided examples are vague ("things happened") or merely state plot points without clearly demonstrating their connection to the theme. Overall, the writing quality is poor, characterized by informal language ("and stuff"), vague phrasing, and simplistic vocabulary, which hinders effective communication and a deeper understanding of the topic.
